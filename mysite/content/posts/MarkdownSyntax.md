## Headings
The following HTML `<h1>` - `<h6>` elements represent six levels of section headings. `<h1>` is the highest section level while `<h6>` is the lowest.

# # H1
## ## H2
### ### H3
#### #### H4
##### ##### H5
###### ###### H6

## Blockquotes
The blockquote element represents content that is quoted from another source. To quote something add `>` before the quote.

## Tables
Tables can be used to organize information. The syntax looks like:
- | Header One     | Header Two     |
- | :------------- | :------------- |
- | Item One       | Item Two       |

| Name     | Age     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Bob      | 27       |
| Alice     | 23    |

## Code Blocks
You can showcase your code inside of code blocks using backticks and curly brackets.

```
{
  <!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Example HTML5 Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Test</p>
</body>
</html>
}
```

# List Types
### Ordered List
1. First item.
2. Second item.
3. Third item.
4. So on ....

### Unordered List
- List item
- Another item
- And another item

## Bold
